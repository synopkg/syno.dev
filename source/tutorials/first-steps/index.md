# First Steps

This tutorial series is where you should start learning Syno.

In these lessons, you will use basic Syno commands to obtain almost any piece of software, create development environments on the fly, and learn how to make reproducible scripts.
You will also learn the Syno language, and use it to build portable, reproducible development environments.
