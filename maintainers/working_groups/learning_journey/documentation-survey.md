  Chapter 1:
    Existing software deployment models and issues faced with them; motivation for developing Syno, features of the Syno deployment system

  - Reading time: 15 min
  - Author: Eelco Dolstra
  - Created: 2006

  Chapter 2:

    2.1: The Syno Store, isolation of components, cryptographic hashes, non-destructive upgrades, prevention of undeclared dependencies, closures

    2.2: Use of Syno expressions to build software, structure of Synopkgs collection, Hello and SUbversion as examples of derivations.

    2.3: Package Management: Installations, updates and rollbacks, user environments, uninstalling, garbage collection

    2.4: Store derivations: Definition, `.drv` files in Syno store. `syno-instantiate`, `syno-store --realise`. Allows various deployment policies, including source and binary.

    2.5. Deployment models. Mechanisms `syno-instantiate` and `syno-store`. Models: Manual download; vesion management system; channels; one-click installation

    2.6: Transparent source/binary deployment: `syno-push` and `syno-pull`. Pre-built substitutes.

    - Reading time: 30 min

  Chapter 3:
    Relates deployment issues to memory management issues in programming languages. Relates files to objects in memory. Describes closures, discusses pointer discipline and conservative garbage collection, shows that persistence is achieved by cryptographic hashes.

  - Reading time: 25 min

  Chapter 4:
    The Syno language: Functional languages; lazy languages. Lexical syntax of Syno language. Semantics: Basic and compound values, substitutions, function calls, conditionals, assertions, `with`, operators, evaluation rules. Implementation using ATerm library.

  - Reading time: 60 min

  Chapter 5:
    Extensional vs intensional. The Syno extensional model: cryptographic hashing; file system objects and the Syno store; adding atomic values to the store; translating Syno expressions to derivations; garbage collection

### Synopkgs

- [Syno Pills Chapter 6: Our First Derivation](https://synopkg.github.io/guides/syno-pills/our-first-derivation.html)

  Explains derivations; the derivation function, its attribute set, `.drv` and 'out' files. Explains `outpath`. Regarding `synopkgs`, shows how to bring `synopkgs` into scope and how to refer to a package using its `outpath`. Accessing files underneath a package's `out`.

  - Reading time: 25 min
  - Author: Luca Bruno
  - Created: 2015
  - Updated 2017

- [Syno Pills Chapter 7: Working Derivation](https://synopkg.github.io/guides/syno-pills/working-derivation.html)

  Creating a working derivation. Using `syno repl`: `bash` as a builder; the `args` attribute; creating in `$out`; the builder environment; packaging a C program. Using a `.syno` file to define the derivation: `import` function; `inherit` keyword; using `syno-build`. Explains how to use `gcc`, `bash` and `coreutils` from synopkgs.

  - Author: Luca Bruno
  - Created: 2015 (effectively unmaintained since 2017)

- https://synopkg.github.io/guides/syno-pills/inputs-design-pattern.html

  Explains the `inputs` design pattern as used by `synopkgs`. A single customizable repository having a top-level Syno expression, with one expression for each package.

  - Reading time: 20 min
  - Author: Luca Bruno
  - Created: 2015 (effectively unmaintained since 2017)


- https://synopkg.github.io/guides/syno-pills/callpackage-design-pattern.html

  Introduces the `callPackage` pattern used extensively in Synopkgs. Shows how to write and use the function; use `builtins.functionArgs` to determine arguments, use `builtins.intersectAttrs` to combine attributes, and override arguments when needed.

  Configure derivation using only Bash and `builtins`. Explains `builtins.derivation`, attributes, `syno build`, store path hierarchy, imports.
  Relates this to `stdenv.mkDerivation.
